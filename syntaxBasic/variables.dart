// Variables in dart are declared using the var keyword.
var name = "Habib";
var age = 25;
var height = 5.8;

// The type of the variable is automatically inferred by the compiler.
// The type of the variable can also be explicitly mentioned.
String name1 = "Habib";
int age1 = 25;

// There are two types of variables in Dart: mutable and immutable.
// Mutable variables can be changed after they are declared.
// Immutable variables cannot be changed after they are declared.

// The final keyword is used to declare a variable whose value cannot be changed.
final String name2 = "Habib";
// we can also use the const keyword to declare a variable whose value cannot be changed.
const String name3 = "Habib";


// The Object type can store any type of value. 
// It is the parent class of all the classes in Dart.
