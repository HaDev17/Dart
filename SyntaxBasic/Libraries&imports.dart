// Libraries  & Imports in Dart
// Libraries are a collection of classes and functions.
// Dart libraries are used to organize code and make it reusable.
// A library can be created by using the library keyword followed by the library name.
// The library name should be a valid Dart identifier.
// The library name should be unique and should not conflict with any other library name.

// Libraries can be imported using the import keyword followed by the library name.
// The import keyword is used to import a single library. for example:

// import all the classes and functions from the dart:math library
import 'dart:math';

//import math library as math so that we can use the math library with the alias math
import 'dart:math' as math;

// import only the sqrt function from the dart:math library
import 'dart:math' show sqrt;

// import all the classes and functions from the dart:math library except the sqrt function
import 'dart:math' hide sqrt;

// This is how you can import a library in Dart.
// We will learn more about libraries and imports in the upcoming sections.
